These are Python code for Machine Learning course's exercise from Coursera, the one taught by Andrew Ng.
You can find the course available online here: https://www.coursera.org/course/ml

These codes require the following libraries:

    Numpy (http://www.numpy.org), for matrix and array manipulations

    Scipy (http://www.scipy.org), used mainly on optimization / minimization functions

    Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org), for plotting

    NLTK (http://www.nltk.org), mainly for preprocessing text in spam detection section

    Sci-Kit Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), used for the SVM section. This is a great machine learning library
    
  In Debain/Ubuntu, you can install above-mentioned libs by following commands:
  sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
  
Don't forget to change the path of the files being loaded in each and everyone of those python files
